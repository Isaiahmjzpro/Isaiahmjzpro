My name is Isaiah and I was born July 21 2008
The reason I chose game developmentðŸŽ® as my program was being I really love paying video games and I want to end up being able to code and make games myself ðŸ¤“
Some projects I wanna end up doing would be creating a really nice looking game and I want to just have the ability to code
